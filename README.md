# [blog](https://www.anwarjamis.com)

This blog was created to share things I've been learning, random reflections I have sometimes, and summaries of entertaining books I read. The topics I will probably talk about the most are finance, technology, and soccer. It was created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and continuous deployment is done using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

In addition to sharing things I find entertaining, the idea behind this blog is to try out new technologies and keep myself constantly programming. Below are instructions on how to create a blog like this in simple steps.
